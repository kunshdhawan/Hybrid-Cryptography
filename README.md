# Hybrid-Cryptography

A Python-based hybrid cryptography system that combines the security of RSA and the efficiency of AES encryption algorithms. This implementation encrypts data using AES for fast symmetric encryption and RSA for securely exchanging the AES key, enabling both high performance and strong security for sensitive data.
